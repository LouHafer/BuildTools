# BuildTools wiki

This page used to help users and project managers to find information about COIN-OR.
Much of it has been moved to https://coin-or.github.io.
Information that is particular for the use of the BuildTools project and/or
the use of autotools will be collected here for now:

- [Working with the GNU Autotools](./autotools)
- [Autotools Basics](./autotools-intro)
- [The configure.ac File](./configure)
- [Configuration Header Files](./config-header)
- [Introduction of Automake Concepts](./automake-intro)
- [The Main Directory Makefile.am File](./make-main)
- [The Source Directories Makefile.am Files](./make-src)
- [The Test Directory Makefile.am File](./make-test)
- [The pkg-config Configuration File](./pcfile)
- ... (more to come)

* [[user-download]]
* [[user-directories]]
* [[user-windows]]
* [[user-configure]]
* [[user-compile]]
* [[user-doxygen]]
* [[user-examples]]
* [[user-troubleshooting]]
* [current-issues](./current-issues)
