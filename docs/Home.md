## Precompiled Libraries and Executables

 * *Linux*: By now, many of the COIN-OR projects have been packaged and are available on Linux distributions for installation with a package manager. On Debian, COIN-OR projects are generally named `coinor-xyz` and can be installed with apt. On Fedora, the naming convention is `coin-or-Xyz`. Pre-compiled binaries are also available for many projects on [BinTray](http://bintray.com/coin-or/download) and as part of the [COIN-OR Optimization Suite](https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/).
 * *Windows*: The easiest way to get COIN-OR projects for Windows is to download binaries from [BinTray](http://bintray.com/coin-or/download) or just use the Windows installer for the [COIN Optimization Suite](http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite), which provides Visual Studio compatible libraries and binaries (these are slightly out of date, however). 
 * *OS X*: Many projects can be installed on OSX through Homebrew, e.g., `brew install xyz`. For other projects, pre-compiled binaries are available from [BinTray](http://bintray.com/coin-or/download)


## Quick Source Download, Build, and Installation Guide

For Unix-like systems (Unix, Linux, MacOS X, Cygwin, MSys), the [quick download and installation guide](./downloadUnix) works in most cases if you don't have particular requirements.

For the the options for building under Windows, see [this page](./user-windows) first. There is also a Wiki dedicated just to the options for building with the [Microsfoft Visual Studio](https://projects.coin-or.org/MSVisualStudio) compilers.
