# BuildTools wiki

This page used to help both users and project managers to find information about COIN-OR.
Much of it has been moved to https://coin-or.github.io.
Information for project managers that is particular for the use of the BuildTools project and/or
the use of autotools is provided here:

- [Working with the GNU Autotools](./autotools)
- [Autotools Basics](./autotools-intro)
- [The configure.ac File](./configure)
- [Configuration Header Files](./config-header)
- [Introduction of Automake Concepts](./automake-intro)
- [The Main Directory Makefile.am File](./make-main)
- [The Source Directories Makefile.am Files](./make-src)
- [The Test Directory Makefile.am File](./make-test)
- [The pkg-config Configuration File](./pcfile)
- [Using Doxygen](./doxygen)
