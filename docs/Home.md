# BuildTools wiki

This page used to help users and project managers to find information about COIN-OR.
Much of it has been moved to https://coin-or.github.io.
Information that is particular for the use of the BuildTools project and/or
the use of autotools will be collected here for now.

---

During transition, some probably outdated information for users is still available here:

* [[user-download]]
* [[user-directories]]
* [[user-windows]]
* [[user-configure]]
* [[user-compile]]
* [[user-doxygen]]
* [[user-examples]]
* [[user-troubleshooting]]
* [current-issues](./current-issues)

Information for project managers that relates to the times that COIN-OR
projects lived in svn repositories and used BuildTools 0.5--0.8 can be found at
https://github.com/coin-or-tools/BuildTools/tree/stable/0.8/doc .
